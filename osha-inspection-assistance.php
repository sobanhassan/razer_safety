        <div class="justify adjust">
          <p>Razer Safety and Health, LLC is an experienced company when it comes to immediately assisting our clients with OSHA inspections and citations. The second an OSHA official knocks at the door, our clients can call us for help. We assist in determining what OSHA standards apply to your company, what training is needed and how to provide the proper documentation. Sometimes our clients feel that complying with OSHA's standards could cause more of a safety hazard; we provide our advice and represent your company appropriately.</p>
          <p>If your company has already been inspected, <strong>you only have 15 days to respond, so don’t wait to call us for help!</strong> By not responding, the citations become final and the employer must pay the defined penalty and comply with OSHA's requirements. Even if the violations are not directly the employer’s fault, they can still be fined. Please see the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&amp;p_id=2024" target="_new">OSHA multi-employer worksite rule</a> for more information.</p>
          <p>Razer Safety and Health, LLC consultants have been consistently successful assisting our clients during informal conferences. It is our mission to achieve a significant reduction or completely eliminate our client's fines. OSHA officials may grant companies that in &quot;good faith&quot; have hired a safety consultant a reduction. Once the informal conference has concluded, our consultants will work hand-in-hand with your company to ensure that the issue does not reoccur.</p>
          <p>It is not recommended that your company wait to find out if it is in compliance. In order to prepare our clients for an OSHA inspection, we recommend setting up a &quot;mock&quot; OSHA inspection; please contact us for more information. OSHA fines can be costly.</p>
          <p>A business forced to pay penalties for noncompliance or law violations will also find the penalties <strong>are not tax deductible</strong>. The tax law specifically denies deductions for fines and penalties paid to the government for violating the law.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, fines and penalties are not generally tax deductible, although fees for safety consultants and professional services are. Amounts paid for consultant services to battle fines and penalties levied for safety violations, as well as many other causes, are tax deductible.</p>
          <p>As an employer, every company, large or small, is responsible for protecting the safety and health of its employees. Safety is also good business. An effective safety and health program can save four to six dollars for every dollar invested. It’s the right thing to do, and doing it right pays off in lower costs, increased productivity, and higher employee morale.</p>

                <p>&quot;I retained Chet Razer on behalf of a mining equipment manufacturer client to testify as an expert in wrongful death litigation pending in Southern West Virginia. We requested he assist us with opinions related to coal mine safety and a variety of dust control related issues. Not only was his background in MSHA and OSHA invaluable, but Chet worked quickly to process a lot of data and drafted an excellent report. I would highly recommend him as a litigation expert.&quot;</p>
