          <p><strong>What people are saying about Chester Razer:</strong></p>
          <p>&ldquo;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation, and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work-related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet&rsquo;s deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Razer Safety and Health Consulting has given our comprehensive safety and health management system a quantum leap in our employee training methodology to avoid and eliminate hazards on our projects. The depth and breadth of Mr. Razer's skill set and background has provided much needed expertise in strengthening our safety culture with a team-like and systematic approach to our goal of zero incidences.&rdquo;</p>
