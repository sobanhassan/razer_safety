          <h2>Breaking News: Coal Groups worry CEOs at risk of liability for violations</h2>
          <p>The Illinois, Ohio, and West Virginia Coal Associations are expressing concerns about repercussions of Don Blankenship's conviction. The Associations are concerned that this case can open the door for safety citations being used to hold anyone working at a coal company liable for criminal conspiracy charges. <a href="https://wvpublic.org/supreme-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-coal-ceo-don-blankenship/" target="_blank">Read more here</a></p>
          <p>On December 17, 2015, the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Labor (DOL) announced a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) to increase the frequency and effectiveness of criminal prosecutions of so-called worker endangerment statutes.  The MOU transfers the prosecution of violations of some statutes – the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act, the Mine Safety and Health (MSH) Act, and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) – from the DOJ Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section to the DOJ&rsquo;s Environment and Natural Resource Division&rsquo;s Environmental Crimes Section.  The memorandum says that the DOJ has trained &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of inspectors to recognize and document prosecutable offenses, and that it would be providing a designated Criminal Coordinator from the DOL to work with local U.S. district attorneys on prosecuting these crimes.

               <p>&quot;Razer's St. Louis Area Office and National Office presentations to OSHA were both well prepared for and professionally delivered. His background with OSHA, made his presence at these meetings, a valuable asset for the possible acceptance by OSHA of the CDC/HBA Fall Prevention Study Proposal.                  Thanks,&quot;<br />
