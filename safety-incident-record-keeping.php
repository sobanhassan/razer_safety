          <h2><strong>Improving safety incident and record keeping is essential to  improving</strong><strong> workplace safety. </strong></h2>
          <p><strong>Improving safety  incident and record keeping is important for several reasons:</strong></p>
          <p>Compliance with  regulations: In many industries, there are regulations and standards that  require companies to record and report workplace accidents, illnesses, and  injuries. This information is used by government agencies to track trends and  monitor the effectiveness of workplace safety programs. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping" target="_blank">OSHA Injury and Illness Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements</a></p>
          <p>Improved understanding  of safety risks: Accident and injury data can be analyzed to identify patterns  and trends that can help organizations better understand the root causes of  workplace incidents. This information can be used to prioritize safety  improvements, target areas for training and education, and allocate resources  to address the most significant risks.</p>
          <p>Better decision making:  Accurate and up-to-date records of workplace incidents can be used to inform  decision-making about workplace safety, such as choosing the right protective  equipment, adjusting work processes to reduce exposure to hazards, and  developing emergency response plans.</p>
          <p>Improved communication  and transparency: Maintaining accurate records of workplace incidents can  improve communication and transparency between workers, management, and  regulators. It can also help to build trust between these groups and  demonstrate a company's commitment to safety.</p>
          <p>Evidence in legal  proceedings: Accident and injury records can serve as valuable evidence in  legal proceedings, such as workers' compensation claims, lawsuits, and  government investigations.</p>
          <p>By improving safety  incident and record keeping, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of  the risks faced by their workers and make informed decisions to promote  workplace safety and prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses.</p>

                <p>&quot;I retained Chet Razer on behalf of a mining equipment manufacturer client to testify as an expert in wrongful death litigation pending in Southern West Virginia. We requested he assist us with opinions related to coal mine safety and a variety of dust control related issues. Not only was his background in MSHA and OSHA invaluable, but Chet worked quickly to process a lot of data and drafted an excellent report. I would highly recommend him as a litigation expert.&quot;</p>
