            <h2>WHAT about Silica???</h2>
            <h2>Let Razer Safety and Health, LLC assist you in navigating the new OSHA Silica Standards.</h2>
            <p>Occupational Safety and Health Administration <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-03-25/pdf/2016-04800.pdf" target="_blank">(OSHA) published its final rule</a> setting new workplace permissible exposure limits (PELs) for respirable crystalline silica. June 23, 2017, was the deadline for compliance for employers in the construction industry, but a 90-day hold was instituted making the <strong>new compliance date September 23, 2017.</strong> In addition to considerably tightening exposure limits, the new rule outlines methods to control silica exposure, procedures for conducting medical exams for workers with high exposure, training obligations for workers about silica-related hazards and record-keeping requirements related to crystalline silica quantities. Under the new rule, the PEL (personal exposure limit) is now 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air (μg/m3), averaged over an eight-hour day. OSHA requires action if the exposure is measured at 25 micrograms per cubic meter of air.</p>
            <p>Those who do not comply with the new OHSA standard <a href="https://www.osha.gov/penalties/" target="_blank">will be subject to</a> a maximum fine of $12,675 for a serious or other-than-serious violation; $12,675 per day past the abatement date for a failure-to-abate violation; and $126,749 for a repeated or willful violation.</p>
            <p>What is Crystalline Silica?  Find answers at OSHA: <a href="https://www.osha.gov/silica-crystalline" target="_blank">https://www.osha.gov/silica-crystalline</a></p>
          <p>OSHA estimates that two million construction workers today are exposed to respirable crystalline silica in more than 600,000 workplaces nationwide – about 840,000 of those workers, OSHA estimates, are currently exposed to silica levels that exceed the new PEL of 50 μg/m3.</p>
            <p>OSHA has published two fact sheets summarizing the requirements of the new standards: a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3681.pdf" target="_blank">Construction Fact Sheet</a> and a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3682.pdf" target="_blank">General Industry and Maritime Fact Sheet</a>.</p>
            <p>Construction companies can refer to the following PDF for guidance: <a href="https://www.osha.gov/silica/SilicaConstructionRegText.pdf" target="_new">https://www.osha.gov/silica/SilicaConstructionRegText.pdf.</a></p>

                <p>&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&quot;<br>
