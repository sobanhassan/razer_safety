                <p>&quot;I retained Chet Razer on behalf of a mining equipment manufacturer client to testify as an expert in wrongful death litigation pending in Southern West Virginia. We requested he assist us with opinions related to coal mine safety and a variety of dust control related issues. Not only was his background in MSHA and OSHA invaluable, but Chet worked quickly to process a lot of data and drafted an excellent report. I would highly recommend him as a litigation expert.&quot;</p>

                <p>&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&quot;</p>
