          <h2>When looking for an expert witness, there are several key  factors to consider:</h2>
          <p><strong>Qualifications and expertise:</strong> Look for an expert with  relevant qualifications, such as degrees or certifications, and extensive  experience in the field related to the case. The expert should have knowledge  and skills that are relevant to the specific issues involved in the case.</p>
          <p><strong>Testimony experience:</strong> It's important to choose an  expert who has experience providing testimony in court or in depositions. This  ensures that they understand the legal process and can effectively communicate  their opinions to a judge or jury.</p>
          <p><strong>Credibility and reputation:</strong> Look for an expert who is  respected in their field and has a reputation for honesty and impartiality.  Check for any past ethical or disciplinary issues.</p>
          <p><strong>Communication skills:</strong> The expert should be able to  clearly explain complex technical information in a way that is easily  understood by non-experts. They should also be able to handle tough  cross-examination questions effectively.</p>
          <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Make sure the expert has the time and  availability to work on the case and to prepare for trial.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Consider the expert's fees and make sure they  are reasonable and within your budget.</p>
          <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> The expert should be easy to work with, understands the goals of the case, and  is willing to work collaboratively with your legal team.</p>

        <div class="testimonials-grid justify adjust">
            <div>
                <p>&quot;I recently retained Chet to consult with on a wrongful death case I that involved worksite safety responsibilities and OSHA issues. Prior to retaining Chet I had interviewed several other experts, but was not comfortable with any of them for a variety of reasons. From my first discussion with Chet it was readily apparent that he has a wealth of experience and knowledge in safety-related matters. Most importantly to me, however, was the fact that Chet did not immediately start offering opinions on the case or otherwise go into a speech about his qualifications. Instead, he listened to what I had to say, then asked a number of pertinent questions and identified various materials that he knew would be critical to the issues in the case. Although I did not then know what opinions Chet may reach in the case, I felt comfortable that he was credible and not an expert that would simply tell you what he thought you wanted to hear.<br>
                <br>
                After reviewing thousands of documents Chet demonstrated a detailed understanding of the case and was very good at educating me on the issues presented. He ultimately wrote a great report which I am confident played a significant role in reaching a fair settlement of the case. At every step in the case Chet was responsive and made himself readily available. He was focused, thorough, knowledgeable, helpful, candid, and straightforward. Although I did not get to see him testify by way of deposition or trial, I knew that he would be credible and well-liked by a jury. I will use Chet in the future and highly recommend him to others."&quot;</p>
