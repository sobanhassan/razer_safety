                <p>&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&quot;<br>

                <p>&quot;I recently retained Chet to consult with on a wrongful death case I that involved worksite safety responsibilities and OSHA issues. Prior to retaining Chet I had interviewed several other experts, but was not comfortable with any of them for a variety of reasons. From my first discussion with Chet it was readily apparent that he has a wealth of experience and knowledge in safety-related matters. Most importantly to me, however, was the fact that Chet did not immediately start offering opinions on the case or otherwise go into a speech about his qualifications. Instead, he listened to what I had to say, then asked a number of pertinent questions and identified various materials that he knew would be critical to the issues in the case. Although I did not then know what opinions Chet may reach in the case, I felt comfortable that he was credible and not an expert that would simply tell you what he thought you wanted to hear.<br>
                After reviewing thousands of documents Chet demonstrated a detailed understanding of the case and was very good at educating me on the issues presented. He ultimately wrote a great report which I am confident played a significant role in reaching a fair settlement of the case. At every step in the case Chet was responsive and made himself readily available. He was focused, thorough, knowledgeable, helpful, candid, and straightforward. Although I did not get to see him testify by way of deposition or trial, I knew that he would be credible and well-liked by a jury. I will use Chet in the future and highly recommend him to others.&quot;<br><br>

                <p>&quot;Razer's vast experience with OSHA / MSHA and his ability to relate to our crews in the field has added tremendous value to our safety and health program. It's nice to know when Chet inspects a job site and talks with employees, a positive impact will follow.&quot;<br />
