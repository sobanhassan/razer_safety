                            <li>The Act allows OSHA to increase the maximum penalties for safety and health violations
                            </li>
                            <li>The increases will become effective by <span data-term="goog_1723732908"
                                    tabindex="0">Aug. 1, 2016</span></li>
                            <li>The penalty amounts will continue to be adjusted for inflation each year</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On Nov. 2, 2015, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (Act), which is a
                            two-year budget deal. One provision in the Act will allow <a href="http://www.osha.gov/"
                                target="_blank">OSHA</a> to increase the maximum penalty amounts it imposes on employers
                            that violate occupational safety and health standards. These increases will become
                            effective <span data-term="goog_1723732909" tabindex="0">Aug. 1, 2016</span>.</p>
                        <h2>Justification for Increased OSHA Penalties</h2>
                        <p>Many government agencies have the authority to adjust their maximum penalty amounts annually
                            to reflect the cost of inflation, as shown by the consumer price index (CPI). However, OSHA
                            has not been allowed to adjust its maximum penalty amounts since the penalties were enacted
                            25 years ago. The Act will allow OSHA to adjust the maximum penalty amounts to reflect
                            inflation.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>OSHA will be allowed to increase its maximum penalties in 2016 and adjust them annually
                                for inflation starting in 2017</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Catch-up Increase</h3>
                        <p>The Act requires OSHA to implement the new maximum penalty amounts in two phases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An initial catch-up adjustment.</li>
                            <li>An ongoing subsequent adjustment period.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The initial catch-up period took place in 2016 and  allowed OSHA to make a cost-of-living
                            adjustment to account for the previous 25 years of non-adjustment. This catch-up increase is
                            capped at 150 percent of current OSHA penalty levels.<br />
                            The Act requires OSHA to indicate the actual amount of the catch-up increase through an
                            interim final rule. Most predictions and speculations surrounding the actual increase
                            amounts hover around an 80 percent increase, because the current CPI index is around 78.2
                            percent higher than what it was when OSHA’s current penalties were adopted.<br />
                            However, the Act also gives OSHA the discretion to increase the current maximum penalty
                            amounts by less than the cost-of-living adjustment if it determines that the full increase
                            will:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Have a negative effect on the economy.</li>
                            <li>Result in social costs that outweigh the benefits of the full increase. The Office of
                                Management and Budget must agree with this determination.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The Act requires OSHA to issue a proposed rule and solicit public comments if it plans to
                        increase the penalty amounts by less than the cost-of-living adjustment. The Act requires OSHA
                        to publish by <strong>July 1, 2016</strong>, how it will implement the first inflation
                        adjustment. The first adjustment must become effective on&nbsp;<strong>Aug. 1, 2016</strong>.
                        <p>The table below shows the speculated 80 percent increase, the maximum increase allowed by the
                            Act, and how those increases would affect maximum OSHA penalty amounts in 2016.</p>

                        <p>Many employers with more than 10 employees – including electrical contractors around the
                            country – are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to keep a record
                            of serious work-related injuries and illnesses. Minor injuries requiring first aid only do
                            not need to be recorded.<br />
                            As part of a new reporting rule issued by OSHA, all employers will be required to submit
                            their 300A Summary electronically beginning on Jan. 1, 2017.<br />
                            Companies with 250 or more employees must start providing additional information in 2018,
                            including the 300A Summary, the 300 log form and all 301 or incident reports that have been
                            purged of employee and physician names and addresses.<br />
                            OSHA has given all employers of 20-249 employees until July 1, 2017, to submit the 300A
                            electronically via its web portal for the calendar year 2016. The deadline is July 1, 2018,
                            for calendar year 2017.<br />
                            OSHA does not prohibit post-incident testing and incentive programs as long as they do not
                            discourage reporting of injuries in any way. If a contractor, for instance, only did
                            post-incident testing after an incident or accident, that could be deemed discriminatory and
                            possibly discourage reporting.<br />
                            A Drug Free Work Place program that has pre-employment testing, random testing and
                            reasonable suspicion testing, along with post-incident testing, would be a program that does
                            not discriminate against an employee simply for being involved in an accident or incident.
                            The total program would discourage drug use in the workplace and protect all employees from
                            these exposures.</p>

                <p>&quot;I retained Chet Razer on behalf of a mining equipment manufacturer client to testify as an expert in wrongful death litigation pending in Southern West Virginia. We requested he assist us with opinions related to coal mine safety and a variety of dust control related issues. Not only was his background in MSHA and OSHA invaluable, but Chet worked quickly to process a lot of data and drafted an excellent report. I would highly recommend him as a litigation expert.&quot;</p>

<p><br />&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof
                  fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation and
                  wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work
                  related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped
                  settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to
                  workplace injuries.&quot;</p>

                    &quot;I have referred many clients to Chet. He is very knowledgeable, practical and responsive.
                    Clients really appreciate that.&quot;</p>

                    &quot;Razer's St. Louis Area Office and National Office presentations to OSHA were both well
                    prepared for and professionally delivered. His background with OSHA, made his presence at these
                    meetings, a valuable asset for the possible acceptance by OSHA of the CDC/HBA Fall Prevention Study
                    Proposal.&quot;</p>
