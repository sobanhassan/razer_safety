The second an OSHA official knocks at the door, our clients can call us for help. We assist in determining what OSHA standards apply to your company, what training is needed and how to provide the proper documentation. Sometimes our clients feel that complying with OSHA's standards could cause more of a safety hazard; we provide our advice and represent your company appropriately.</p>
				<p>If  your company has already been inspected, <strong>you  only have 15 days to respond, so don’t wait to call us for help!</strong> By not  responding, the citations become final and the employer must pay the defined  penalty and comply with&nbsp;OSHA's requirements. Even if the violations are  not directly the employer’s fault, they can still be fined. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&amp;p_id=2024" target="_new">OSHA&nbsp;multi-employer  worksite rule</a>&nbsp;for  more information.<br />
                  <br />
Razer Safety &amp; Health consultants have been consistently successful  assisting our clients during informal conferences. It is our mission to achieve  a significant reduction or completely eliminate our client's fines. OSHA  officials may grant companies that are in &quot;good faith&quot; and have hired  a safety consultant a 20% reduction. Once the informal conference has  concluded, our consultants will work hand-in-hand with your company to ensure that  the issue does not reoccur.<br />
<br />
It is not recommended that your company wait to find out if it is in  compliance. In order to prepare our clients for an OSHA inspection, we  recommend setting up a &quot;mock&quot; OSHA inspection; please contact us for  more information. OSHA fines can be costly.</p>
				<p>A business forced to pay penalties for noncompliance or law violations will also find the penalties are not tax deductible. The tax law specifically denies deductions for fines and penalties paid to the government for  violating the law.<br />
                  <br />
As mentioned, fines and penalties are not generally tax deductible, although  fees for safety consultants and professional services are. Amounts paid for consultant  services to battle fines and penalties levied for safety violations, as well as  many other causes, are tax deductible.</p>
                <p>As  an employer, every company, large or small, is responsible for protecting the  safety and health of its employees. Safety is also good business. An effective  safety and health program can save four to six dollars for every dollar  invested. It’s the right thing to do, and doing it right pays off in lower  costs, increased productivity, and higher employee morale. </p>

				<p>&quot;I recently retained Chet to consult with on a wrongful death case I that involved worksite safety responsibilities and OSHA issues. Prior to retaining Chet I had interviewed several other experts, but was not comfortable with any of them for a variety of reasons. From my first discussion with Chet it was readily apparent that he has a wealth of experience and knowledge in safety-related matters. Most importantly to me, however, was the fact that Chet did not immediately start offering opinions on the case or otherwise go into a speech about his qualifications. Instead, he listened to what I had to say, then asked a number of pertinent questions and identified various materials that he knew would be critical to the issues in the case. Although I did not then know what opinions Chet may reach in the case, I felt comfortable that he was credible and not an expert that would simply tell you what he thought you wanted to hear.</p>
                <p>After reviewing thousands of documents Chet demonstrated a detailed understanding of the case and was very good at educating me on the issues presented. He ultimately wrote a great report which I am confident played a significant role in reaching a fair settlement of the case. At every step in the case Chet was responsive and made himself readily available. He was focused, thorough, knowledgeable, helpful, candid, and straightforward. Although I did not get to see him testify by way of deposition or trial, I knew that he would be credible and well-liked by a jury.  I will use Chet in the future and highly recommend him to others.&quot;</p>

					&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a  commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury  site, conducted an investigation and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking  OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work related mannerisms  that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped  settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety  consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&quot;</p>
