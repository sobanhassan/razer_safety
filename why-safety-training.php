        <h1 align="center">Safety Training</h1>
        <div class="justify adjust">
          <p>Safety training is essential for employees for several  reasons:</p>
          <p><strong>Preventing Accidents and Injuries</strong>: The primary goal  of safety training is to help prevent accidents and injuries in the workplace.  By providing employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to identify and  avoid potential hazards, they can work more safely and effectively.</p>
          <p><strong>Compliance with Regulations</strong>: Depending on the industry,  there may be various safety regulations and guidelines that companies must  follow. Safety training helps ensure that employees are aware of these  regulations and understand how to comply with them.
          <p><strong>Reducing Costs:</strong> Workplace accidents and injuries can  be expensive for companies, resulting in lost productivity, increased insurance  premiums, and potential legal liabilities. Safety training can help reduce the  risk of accidents and injuries, thereby lowering costs for the company.</p>
          <p><strong>Improving Employee Morale</strong>: Employees who feel safe and secure  in their work environment are likely to be more productive and have higher  morale. Safety training can help instill a culture of safety in the workplace,  which can improve employee satisfaction and engagement.</p>
          <p><strong>Enhancing Reputation</strong>: Companies that prioritize  safety are often viewed more positively by customers, suppliers, and other  stakeholders. Safety training can help demonstrate a company's commitment to  safety and enhance its reputation in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Overall, safety training is an investment in  both the well-being of employees and the success of the company. By  prioritizing safety and providing employees with the knowledge and skills they  need to work safely, companies can create a more productive, engaged, and  successful workforce. </p>
          <h2>Written Safety Plans</h2>
          <p>Written safety &amp; health plans are an  important part of a company’s safety &amp; health program. Not only  does&nbsp;OSHA&nbsp;require companies to have written programs, but oftentimes  contractors require safety &amp; health programs to be submitted as part of  the&nbsp;pre-qualification  process. </p>
          <p>It is essential to have your company’s safety plans in writing,  as documentation to reference what the company’s practices, rules, and  guidelines are for a variety of areas.&nbsp; In the event of an incident,  audit, or inspection, it’s vital to have the documentation as a  reference.&nbsp; Safety and health training is built from the information that  is contained in the written programs, and having written safety and health  programs helps to build a company’s safety culture by prioritizing safety.</p>
          <p>Through the audit  process, Razer Safety and Health will discuss your company’s operation and  hazards that your employees may encounter in addition to specific information  such as persons responsible for implementing your safety &amp; health program,  hazards specific to your operation, personal protective equipment that is  utilized, evacuation routes and procedures, and more. Once your company’s  information has been obtained, we will be equipped with the information needed  to develop customized safety programs for your company.

                <p>&quot;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation and wrote a great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology and his work related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet’s deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&quot;<br>

                <p>&quot;Razer's vast experience with OSHA / MSHA and his ability to relate to our crews in the field has added tremendous value to our safety and health program. It's nice to know when Chet inspects a job site and talks with employees, a positive impact will follow.&quot;<br />
