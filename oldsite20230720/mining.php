		      <p><strong>In an effort to assist mining operations in  their compliance efforts, MSHA is providing a list of the &quot;Most Frequently Cited Standards&quot;  by mine type. </strong><a href="https://arlweb.msha.gov/stats/top20viols/top20home.asp" target="_blank"><strong>https://arlweb.msha.gov/stats/top20viols/top20home.asp</strong></a></p>

                  The Part 75  Exam Rule Calculator allows mine operators, miners and others to calculate a  mine's violation rate for nine key health and safety standards for underground  coal mines, as identified in MSHA's <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=25295969a44c2173bd051b57a24ce06a&amp;node=pt30.1.75&amp;rgn" target="_blank">Part 75 Exam Rule</a> requiring examinations and recordkeeping by  mine operators. The standards address ventilation, methane, roof control,  combustible materials, rock dust, guarding, and other safeguards.</p>
<h3>Breaking News: Coal Groups worry CEOs at risk of liability for violations</h3>
			<p>The Illinois, Ohio, and West Virginia Coal Associations are expressing concerns about repercussions of Don Blankenship's conviction. The Associations are concerned that this case can open the door for safety citations being used to hold anyone working at a coal company liable for criminal conspiracy charges. <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/news/20160706/coal-groups-raise-criminal-liability-concerns-for-ceos" target="_blank">Read more here</a></p>

			<p>On December 17, 2015, the U.S. Departments of  Justice (DOJ) and Labor (DOL) announced a new memorandum of understanding (MOU)  to increase the frequency and effectiveness of criminal prosecutions of  so-called worker endangerment statutes.&nbsp; The MOU transfers the prosecution  of violations of some statutes – the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act,  the Mine Safety and Health (MSH) Act, and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural  Worker Protection Act (MSPA) – from the DOJ Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section  to the DOJ&rsquo;s Environment and Natural Resource Division&rsquo;s Environmental Crimes  Section. &nbsp;The memorandum says that the DOJ has trained &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of  inspectors to recognize and document prosecutable offenses, and that it would  be providing a designated Criminal Coordinator from the DOL to work with local  U.S. district attorneys on prosecuting these crimes.

			<p>&quot;I retained Chet Razer on behalf of a mining equipment manufacturer client to testify as an expert in wrongful death litigation pending in Southern West Virginia. We requested he assist us with opinions related to coal mine safety and a variety of dust control related issues. Not only was his background in MSHA and OSHA invaluable, but Chet worked quickly to process a lot of data and drafted an excellent report. I would highly recommend him as a litigation expert.&quot;</p>

            <p><br />&quot;We found Chet to be extremely thorough, prompt, and professional. He  really knows this area of the law and was very helpful for our case.&quot;</p>

				&quot;Razer's vast experience with OSHA / MSHA and his ability to relate to our crews in the field has added tremendous value to our safety and health program. It's nice to know when Chet inspects a jobsite and talks with employees, a positive impact will follow.&quot;<br />
