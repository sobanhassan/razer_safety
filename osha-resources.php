          <h2><strong>OSHA’s Top 10 Safety  Violations 2023</strong></h2>
          
              <p>For   the 13th consecutive year, general requirements for fall protection   topped the list of the most-cited violations recorded by the   Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).</p>
              <p>Region 6   Administrator Eric Harbin presented OSHA’s annual top 10 list at the   recent National Safety Council (NSC) Safety Congress &amp; Expo in New   Orleans. The numbers covered the 2023 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2022 to Sept.   30, 2023).</p>
              <p>Fall Protection-General Requirements featured a total   of 7,271 violations, more than double that of the second-highest cited   item, Hazard Communication (3,213). Ladders (2,978) and Scaffolding   (2,859) came in third and fourth on the list, further highlighting the   need for proper precautions when working at heights.</p>
              <p>The order of   the top 10 violations remained largely the same as in 2022, with only   two items moving more than one spot in either direction. Respiratory   Protection fell from fourth to seventh on the list, while Powered   Industrial Trucks climbed from seventh to fifth.</p>
              <p>Each of the   standards above saw a significant increase in their total numbers cited   and each of them appeared on last year’s last list although the order   shifted somewhat as is common from year to year. For the 13th   consecutive year, fall protection (general requirements) was the most   frequently cited violation.</p>
              <p>As employers consider reviewing and   strengthening their safety and health practices for 2024, the Top 10   list is always a good place to start such efforts.</p>

              </strong><em>Standard (Standard Number) – Violations</em></p>

          <h3>The Bottom 5</h3>
          <p>Just as the top 5 OSHA standards have  remained the same but shifted positions, so have the bottom five standards on  the OSHA's Top 10 list.</p>
          <p>The&nbsp;Powered Industrial Trucks standard  has moved up two spots on the list and deals with the operation design,  maintenance, and training of mobile equipment like&nbsp;forklifts. Perhaps this  increase reflects the labor crunch many companies, especially those in  logistics and warehousing, have felt over the past year as they try to fulfill  the demand for goods while short-staffed.</p>
          <p>These shortages may push some to cut corners  regarding proper employee training, inspections, and maintenance while hiring  less skilled workers to operate the equipment. As a result, OSHA inspectors may  find more violations than they would otherwise. </p>
          <h3>Impact on Workers, Business and Profit</h3>
          <p>Employers that want to reduce injury in  accident rates and avoid potentially costly regulatory fines must take this  list seriously and see if it illuminates any of their safety and health  programs' shortcomings.</p>
          <p>If an OSHA inspector shows up for a  surprise inspection, these top 10 standards will likely be at the top of their  mind and something they will look for at your facility. Reading and reviewing  these top 10 standards for comprehension and how they might apply to your  workplace is a perfect place to start to ensure your organization isn't caught  off guard.</p>
          <h3>The Need for Training and Prevention</h3>
          <p>What are some of the most important things  your company needs to focus on to ensure you don't get hit with one of these most  cited regulations?<br />
          Safety audits&nbsp;are one of the  essential safety and health program tools. Audits help you identify hazards in  your workplace so that you can proactively manage and eliminate them before  they can turn into workplace injuries or accidents.</p>
          <p>Different people see different hazards,  and something you might miss may be evident to another person with different  experiences. That's why it is helpful to have Razer Safety and Health perform  periodic workplace audits and mentor your team members on identifying hazards.</p>
          <p>OSHA requires that companies create  written safety programs and periodically update and review them. Razer Safety  and Health can audit your organization's current safety and health plans and  procedures to ensure they include the requirements established by the top 10  standards.</p>
          <p>Finally, an essential component of  workplace safety and compliance is training employees to recognize and mitigate  the hazards they are likely to encounter. Therefore, audit your current  training to identify gaps related to the OSHA's top 10 list and create a plan  to fill those gaps.</p>
          <p>Make sure that you  are proactive when it comes to training and staying on top of it. The longer  you wait to conduct training, the more likely your workers are to be involved  in an accident, and OSHA is to show up on-site and realize that you have not  been conducting the mandatory training.</p>
          <h2>When should I report  accidents to OSHA?</h2>
          <p>You should report accidents to the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA) if they meet the criteria for a &quot;serious  injury.&quot; Under OSHA regulations, a serious injury is defined as one that  results in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Death</li>
            <li>Hospitalization for more than 24 hours for other than  medical observation</li>
            <li>Loss of an eye</li>
            <li>Loss of a body part</li>
            <li>Significant disfigurement</li>
            <li>Fractured or compressed vertebra</li>
            <li>A punctured eardrum</li>
            <li>Permanent hearing loss</li>
            <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
            <li>Diagnosis of a serious illness (e.g., cancer, heart disease)  that is directly related to workplace exposure)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>After a workplace accident what questions should I ask?</h3>
          <p>If you're involved in a workplace accident, it's important  to take the following steps to ensure that you get the help you need and that  the incident is properly documented:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seek medical attention if necessary: If you're injured, it's  important to get prompt medical attention. This not only helps you get the care  you need but also creates a record of the injury.</li>
            <li>Report the accident: Report the accident to your supervisor  or employer as soon as possible. This will help ensure that the incident is  properly documented and that the necessary steps are taken to prevent similar  accidents from happening in the future.</li>
            <li>Gather information: If you're able to do so, gather  information about the accident while it's still fresh in your mind. This might  include taking photos of the scene, getting the names and contact information  of witnesses, and making notes about what happened.</li>
            <li>Ask the following questions:
              <ul>
                <li>What caused the accident?</li>
                <li>Were there any safety violations or hazards that contributed  to the accident?</li>
                <li>Was proper safety equipment or personal protective equipment  provided and used?</li>
                <li>Were there any procedural or training deficiencies that  contributed to the accident?</li>
                <li>Will there be an investigation into the accident?</li>
                <li>What is the next step in the process, and what kind of  support and resources will be provided?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
                <p><strong>By asking these questions, you can help ensure that the  root cause of the accident is identified and addressed. That measures are taken  to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future and have information  available when OHSA makes follow up inspection after accident report.</strong></p>
          <h3>If I am an employer what questions should I ask after accident?</h3>
                <p>As an employer, it's important to take a thorough and  comprehensive approach to investigating workplace accidents to ensure that the  root cause is identified and addressed. When investigating, it's important to  ask the following questions.</p>
               <p>By asking these questions and gathering as much information  as possible about the accident, you can help ensure that you have a complete  and accurate understanding of what happened and what can be done to prevent  similar accidents from happening in the future. <strong>As employer you will be  prepared for OSHA Visit following the report of an accident.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What caused the accident?</li>
                  <li>Were there any safety violations or hazards that contributed  to the accident?</li>
                  <li>Was proper safety equipment or personal protective equipment  provided and used?</li>
                  <li>Were there any procedural or training deficiencies that  contributed to the accident?</li>

                  <li>What were the conditions at the time of the accident (e.g.,  weather, lighting, equipment, etc.)?</li>
                  <li>Were there any warning signs or indications that the  accident was about to occur?</li>
                  <li>Was the work being performed within the scope of the  employee's job responsibilities?</li>
                  <li>What steps were taken immediately following the accident?</li>
                  <li>Was first aid provided?</li>
                  <li>Was the proper medical attention sought?</li>
                  <li>Was the scene secured to preserve evidence?<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>OSHA General Duty Clause</h2>
                <p>The OSHA (Occupational Safety and  Health Administration) General Duty Clause is a provision in the Occupational  Safety and Health Act of 1970 that requires employers to provide a safe and  healthful workplace for their employees. Specifically, the General Duty Clause  states that employers must furnish &quot;a place of employment which is free  from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or  serious physical harm to his employees.&quot;</p>
          <p>The General Duty Clause is often  used by OSHA to cite employers for violations of safety and health standards <u>that  do not have a specific OSHA regulation</u>. For example, if there is a hazard  in the workplace that is not addressed by an OSHA standard, OSHA can use the  General Duty Clause to cite the employer for failing to provide a safe  workplace.</p>
                <p>To use the General Duty Clause, OSHA  must establish that the employer:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Had a duty to protect employees from  a hazard.</li>
                  <li>Knew or should have known of the  hazard.</li>
                  <li>Failed to take reasonable steps to  eliminate or reduce the hazard.</li>
                  <li>The hazard was causing or likely to  cause death or serious physical harm to employees.</li>
                </ul>
<p>Employers can prevent violations of  the General Duty Clause by identifying and addressing potential hazards in the  workplace, providing adequate training to employees, and maintaining a culture  of safety.</p>
<p>By using Razer Safety and Health, LLC to provide  safety audits or &ldquo;mock&rdquo; OSHA Inspection employers can identify and avoid  potential hazards that may result in a citation, violation, and penalties. </p>
