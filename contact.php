                <p>&quot;We consider ourselves very fortunate to have Chet Razer available as a resource to our workplace wellness and safety teams at Gilster-Mary Lee. Chet offers a unique set of skills and experience, has always been very responsive to our needs, and offered very sound counsel and support in the issues we have presented to him. His business is a great example of how a consulting partner can support a client in an effective and cost efficient manner.&quot;</p>

               <p>&quot;Razer's St. Louis Area Office and National Office presentations to OSHA were both well prepared for and professionally delivered. His background with OSHA, made his presence at these meetings, a valuable asset for the possible acceptance by OSHA of the CDC/HBA Fall Prevention Study Proposal.                  Thanks,&quot;<br />
