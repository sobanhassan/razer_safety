        <div class="justify adjust">
          <p><strong>How can I as a contractor get to bid on bigger jobs?</strong></p>
          <p>As a contractor, there are several strategies you can use to  bid on bigger jobs and grow your business.</p>
          <p><strong>Build Your Reputation:</strong> A good reputation is critical  in the construction industry, and clients are more likely to choose contractors  with a proven track record of quality workmanship, timely delivery, and fair  pricing. You can build your reputation by starting with smaller projects and  consistently delivering high-quality work, earning positive reviews and  referrals from satisfied clients.</p>
          <p><strong>Develop Your Skills and Expertise: </strong>To win larger  jobs, you need to demonstrate expertise in your field. Consider investing in  additional training or certifications that will enhance your skills and  credentials. For example, you could specialize in a particular type of  construction, such as green building, or become an expert in specific  construction area.</p>
          <p><strong>Network and Build Relationships:</strong> Building  relationships with potential clients, industry partners, and other contractors  can help you identify new business opportunities and gain referrals for larger  jobs. Attend industry events, join trade associations, sign up with a  contractor prequalification site and participate in online forums and social  media groups to expand your network.</p>
          <p><strong>Develop a Strong Proposal:</strong> When bidding on larger  jobs, your proposal should be comprehensive, detailed, and tailored to the  client's needs. Consider hiring Razer Safety and Health to help you develop a  strong proposal that highlights your expertise, safety record and sets you  apart from the competition.</p>
          <p><strong>Partner with Other Contractors:</strong> Partnering with other  contractors or subcontractors can help you win larger projects that require a  broader range of expertise or resources. Look for opportunities to collaborate  with other contractors on projects and develop a network of trusted partners  you can call on when you need additional support.</p>
          <p><strong>Secure Financing and Insurance:</strong> Larger projects often  require significant upfront costs, including equipment, labor, and materials.  Ensure you have the necessary financing and insurance coverage to take on  larger projects and meet your clients' needs.<br />
            By implementing these strategies and continuously improving  your skills and reputation, you can position your contracting business to bid  on bigger jobs and grow your business over time.</p>
          <p><strong>Razer Safety and Health, LLC</strong> will help you prepare  for these opportunities.</p>

                <p>&quot;I recently retained Chet to consult with on a wrongful death case I that involved worksite safety responsibilities and OSHA issues. Prior to retaining Chet I had interviewed several other experts, but was not comfortable with any of them for a variety of reasons. From my first discussion with Chet it was readily apparent that he has a wealth of experience and knowledge in safety-related matters. Most importantly to me, however, was the fact that Chet did not immediately start offering opinions on the case or otherwise go into a speech about his qualifications. Instead, he listened to what I had to say, then asked a number of pertinent questions and identified various materials that he knew would be critical to the issues in the case. Although I did not then know what opinions Chet may reach in the case, I felt comfortable that he was credible and not an expert that would simply tell you what he thought you wanted to hear.<br>
                After reviewing thousands of documents Chet demonstrated a detailed understanding of the case and was very good at educating me on the issues presented. He ultimately wrote a great report which I am confident played a significant role in reaching a fair settlement of the case. At every step in the case Chet was responsive and made himself readily available. He was focused, thorough, knowledgeable, helpful, candid, and straightforward. Although I did not get to see him testify by way of deposition or trial, I knew that he would be credible and well-liked by a jury. I will use Chet in the future and highly recommend him to others.&quot;<br><br>
