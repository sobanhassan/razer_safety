            <h2>OSHA Field Guide: Understand Workplace Safety & Save Money
            </h2>
            <p><strong><em>OSHA Field Guide: Understand Workplace Safety & Save Money </em></strong>while protecting your company and team members. Here, at last, are the hard-to-find answers to the dizzying array of OSHA questions that plague employers. Razer will answer the questions that keep you up at night, and he'll provide answers to many questions you haven't even considered but should. Using his years of field and management experience as a safety expert, Razer has designed and written this book to help employers who would like to know more about their obligations regarding health and safety matters in the workplace, as mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act). The book can be read chapter by chapter, from start to finish, or by "cherry picking" individual chapters of interest. Use the book as a road map to other documents that deliver greater "in-depth" coverage of areas of interest. In addition, it provides information about the OSH Act for persons other than employers who may be interested in how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducts its business.</p>

            <p><strong>What people are saying about Chester  Razer:</strong></p>
            <p>&ldquo;We consulted with and hired Chet Razer  as an expert witness to inspect a commercial roof fall/injury in Southwest  Missouri. Chet came to the injury site, conducted an investigation, and wrote a  great report. Chet is a walking OHSA manual. You can tell from the terminology  and his work-related mannerisms that he lives and breathes safety. Chet&rsquo;s  deposition went flawlessly and helped settle our case before trial. I highly  recommend Chet Razer as a safety consultant in regard to workplace injuries.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
  &ldquo;Razer Safety and  Health Consulting has given our comprehensive safety and health management  system a quantum leap in our employee training methodology to avoid and  eliminate hazards on our projects. The depth and breadth of Mr. Razer's skill  set and background has provided much needed expertise in strengthening our  safety culture with a team-like and systematic approach to our goal of zero  incidences.&rdquo;</p>
